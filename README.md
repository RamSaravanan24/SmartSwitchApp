Hello! , this smart switch was done as a College project , obviously this has a lot of bug which i will take care of , as this is only at about 80% completion.
I still need to do a bit of changes to the whole "appearance" thing.

Before you start using the program , there are some things you want to do first ( assuming you are using the same ESP8266 ) module.
Step 1:
    --> Go to File --> Preferences --> Addtional Board Manager --> http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json --> paste the link.
Step 2:
    --> Tools --> Boards --> esp8266 --> Generic ESP8266 Module.

Have Fun!.
